### Abstract

TruckPup is a cross-platform mobile application designed for food truck vendors in the Louisville Food Truck Association. Food truck vendors operate at different locations with flexible hours, making it inconvenient for a customer to reliably eat at their favorite truck.

TruckPup connects customers and vendors by broadcasting a truckâ€™s current geocoded position through our mobile app and Facebook. The mobile app also provides other truck-specific information such as operational status, menu information, and upcoming events.

Data is handled efficiently and securely using a customized website hosted on a cloud server.
